## Steps to make this your own:
1. Fork this repository
2. Click on the settings tab
3. Change the repository name `username.github.io` to have your github username instead of "username". Foe example, my username is alannarisse so I would change it to `alannarisse.github.io`
4. Open the GitHub Desktop app.
5. Find the repository and make some magic happen using a code editor like [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
6. Save your stuff and push it back up to GitHub.
7. take a spoonful of honey.
